<h1 id="Choose-your-adventure">Choose your adventure<a class="anchor-link" href="#Choose-your-adventure"> </a></h1><p>At this stage we will be training a neural network to approximate a likelihood or likelihood ratio for down-stream statistical analysis. The papers mentioned in the <a href="/madminer-tutorial/intro.html">Intro</a> describe these techniques in detail. There are three options for this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>an approximate likelihood ratio (<strong>recommended for tutorial</strong>)</li>
<li>an approximate score, which is like the optimal observables (<strong>stretch goal for tutorial</strong>)</li>
<li>an approximate likelihood (like a high-dimensional histogram, but with a neural network)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where the machine learning training happens, and MadMiner uses pytorch.</p>
