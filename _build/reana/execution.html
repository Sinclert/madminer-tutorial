<p>This section describes executing the workflow on a REANA instance running on a remote cluster. 
This section assumes that you have installed and configured the REANA client and the MLFlow tracking server as described <a href="preliminaries">here</a>.</p>
<p>To determine if the connection is established check the following output</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>reana-client ping
</pre></div>

<pre><code>REANA server: &lt;REANA_URL_SERVER&gt;
REANA server version: 0.7.1
REANA client version: 0.7.2
Authenticated as: &lt;username&gt; &lt;username@institution&gt;
Status: Connected</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> in the complete workflow repository  defines a high-level command for submitting the job to a REANA cluster (the sub-workflows do not). 
To launch the workflow on the remote REANA instance, simply type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make reana-run
</pre></div>
<p>You should see an output similar to this</p>

<h2 id="Local-monitoring-of-remote-workflows">Local monitoring of remote workflows<a class="anchor-link" href="#Local-monitoring-of-remote-workflows"> </a></h2><p>You can monitor the workflows and retrieve output files from your local browser by setting up a local monitor of the remote workflow than from the working directory at the clusterâ€™s institution.  If you haven't already done it, follow the instructions <a href="preliminaries.html#Local-monitoring-of-remote-workflows">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can access individual files either from the web interface or with the <code>reana-client</code> CLI

<p>You can also directly view some files, like this plot:</p>

<p>You can also inspect the logs for different steps in the workflow (eg. generate and plotting below)</p>
