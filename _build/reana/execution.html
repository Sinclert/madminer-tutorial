<p>Both the complete workflow as well as the sub-workflow repositories define a series of high-level commands by the definition of a Makefile. The main command that it exposes is the yadage-run command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make yadage-run
</pre></div>
<p>This command would run the specified workflow within the workflow folder, generating a set of results within the .yadage folder (invisible folder only accessible via terminal or IDE).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> .yadage
ls -l
</pre></div>
<p>Remote deployment
The local deployment makes reference to the use of REANA as the execution coordinator.</p>
<p>In this case, only the complete workflow exposes a Makefile high-level command to use REANA as the deployment and coordination platform. However, it requires a preliminar configuration in order for our reana-client CLI to be able to connect with a REANA instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Optional. Only if a virtual env was created</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/.virtualenvs/reana/bin/activate

<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">REANA_ACCESS_TOKEN</span><span class="o">=</span>“&lt;your access token here&gt;”
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">REANA_SERVER_URL</span><span class="o">=</span>“&lt;the REANA instance URL here&gt;”
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">REANA_WORKON</span><span class="o">=</span>madminer-workflow
</pre></div>
<p>To determine if the connection is established check the following output</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>reana-client ping
</pre></div>

<pre><code>REANA server: &lt;REANA_URL_SERVER&gt;
REANA server version: 0.7.1
REANA client version: 0.7.2
Authenticated as: &lt;username&gt; &lt;username@institution&gt;
Status: Connected</code></pre>
<p>There is, however, a shortcut in the case that the REANA instance has been installed locally in the same computer where the workflow has been cloned. Only in those cases, users could use the reana-dev CLI tool to automatically set up some environment variables for them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Mandatory, as REANA was installed locally</span>
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/.virtualenvs/reana/bin/activate

<span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="k">$(</span>reana-dev client-setup-environment<span class="k">)</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">REANA_WORKON</span><span class="o">=</span>madminer-workflow
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, and on the same terminal window, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make reana-run
</pre></div>
<p>You should see an output similar to this</p>

<h2 id="Local-monitoring-of-remote-workflows">Local monitoring of remote workflows<a class="anchor-link" href="#Local-monitoring-of-remote-workflows"> </a></h2><p>If we have access to a remote REANA server instance, it is more helpful to monitor the workflows and retrieve output files from the local browser than from the working directory at the cluster’s institution.  Here are the steps to do it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#local terminal, ssh to the institution hosting the REANA server</span>
ssh -q -L &lt;port&gt;:&lt;REANA_SERVER_URL&gt;:&lt;port&gt; &lt;username&gt;@&lt;institution&gt;
<span class="c1">#if the previous command brings you to a bastion, go ahead and login to your workspace</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In the case of Brookhaven National Lab, the REANA server is located at</p>

<pre><code>REANA_SERVER_URL=”https://kubmaster01.sdcc.bnl.gov:30443” (port=30443)
REANA_ACCESS_TOKEN contact with admin</code></pre>
<p>You can now check the progress of your workflows in <code>https://localhost:&lt;port&gt;</code> on your local browser and download output files. Congratulations!</p>
