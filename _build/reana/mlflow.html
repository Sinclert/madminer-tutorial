<h1 id="Bonus:-MLFlow">Bonus: MLFlow<a class="anchor-link" href="#Bonus:-MLFlow"> </a></h1><p>MLFlow is a framework that offers developers a consistent way of (1) defining ML projects, (2) run parameterized experiments on those projects, and (3) track results, metrics and artifacts from run to run.</p>
<p>In the case of this workflow, MLFlow has been integrated to the ML part of the workflow, in order to provide the third capability: the tracking of results and metrics on consecutive (but different) runs. Therefore, the following explanations apply to the ML sub-workflow, and the complete workflow only, leaving the physics sub-workflow un-affected.</p>
