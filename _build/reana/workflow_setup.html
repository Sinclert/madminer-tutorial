<h1 id="Workflow-setup">Workflow setup<a class="anchor-link" href="#Workflow-setup"> </a></h1><p>In order to setup the workflow locally, you can just clone the <a href="https://github.com/scailfin/madminer-workflow">madminer-workflow</a> repository,  as long as the two wrapped sub-workflows by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/scailfin/madminer-workflow
</pre></div>
<p>This command will also clone the phyiscs (PH) and machine learning (ML) sub-workflows inside the modules folder. You can also install them separately (if you want to interact with them in a separate manner), by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/scailfin/madminer-workflow-ml
git clone https://github.com/scailfin/madminer-workflow-ph
</pre></div>
<p>Then, depending whether you want to run the workflow locally, or remotely, both Yadage and the <code>reana-client</code> command line interface (CLI) would need to be installed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip3 install yadage
pip3 install reana-client
</pre></div>
<p>The official documentation and the README files of these repositories recommend creating a Python virtual environment to install these packages. However, if your interaction with the project is going to be from a user perspective, this is not mandatory.</p>
<p>If you are running locally with yadage, then you will also need to have Docker installed, as it will be used as the DockerHub image-pulling mechanism. Note, installing docker was already part of the tutorial and was described in the <a href="../preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> section.</p>
