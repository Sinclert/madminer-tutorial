# Bonus: MLFlow

MLFlow is a framework that offers developers a consistent way of (1) defining ML projects, (2) run parameterized experiments on those projects, and (3) track results, metrics and artifacts from run to run.

In the case of this workflow, MLFlow has been integrated to the ML part of the workflow, in order to provide the third capability: the tracking of results and metrics on consecutive (but different) runs. Therefore, the following explanations apply to the ML sub-workflow, and the complete workflow only, leaving the physics sub-workflow un-affected.
