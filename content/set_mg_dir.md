# Set the MadGraph Directory

In part `2a_parton_level` and/or `2b_delphes_level_analysis` in Cell 3, the location of MadGraph is set.
In this webpage it is listed as 
```
mg_dir = '/Users/johannbrehmer/work/projects/madminer/MG5_aMC_v2_6_5â€™
```

In the GitHub repository it has been updated to be be consistent with the docker container:
```
mg_dir = 'mg_dir = '/home/software/MG5_aMC_v2_6_2'
```

If you install everything yourself, then you would need to change this.
