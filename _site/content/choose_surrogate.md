At this stage we will be training a neural network to approximate a likelihood or likelihood ratio for down-stream statistical analysis. The papers mentioned in the [Intro](/madminer-tutorial/intro.html) describe these techniques in detail. There are three options for this section:

* an approximate likelihood ratio (**recommended for tutorial**, ~20 min)
* an approximate score, which is like the optimal observables (**stretch goal for tutorial**)
* an approximate likelihood (like a high-dimensional histogram, but with a neural network)

This is where the machine learning training happens, and MadMiner uses pytorch.
