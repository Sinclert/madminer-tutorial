At this stage we have a trained model to approximate a likelihood, likelihood ratio, or score. With this we are now ready to do statistical analysis of the data. We might either want to analyze real data for observed results or simulated data for expected results.

* Limits on EFT parameters (**recommended for tutorial**, ~5 min)
* Fisher information (**stretch goal for tutorial**, ~1 min)
* Information Geometry (**stretch goal for tutorial**, ~2 min)
