At this stage we will be generating simulated events. This includes the detector simulation. We can either use:

* Parton Level with a simple smearing (faster)
* With Delphes fast simulation (more realistic)

The MadMiner technique can also work with the full GEANT4 simulation of the events, but this is too heavy and experiment specific to package with the tool. The Delphes example provides a template for what it would look like in a full experimental context.
