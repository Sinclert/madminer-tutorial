# Morphing


We have an interactive demo for the morphing in [this notebook](https://github.com/diana-hep/madminer/blob/master/examples/morphing_basis/interactive_basis_chooser.ipynb). You may need to add a line at the top with `!pip install bqplot==0.11.9`, to be fixed.

The result is here

You can run the interactive basis chooser by opening this notebook in the container:
